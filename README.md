# QR Code Scanner App

This application is the result of a project created as a part of my job application process at PT Mypro Solusindo Informatika. 

To avoid fat apk, I build apk with the command ``` flutter build apk --split-per-abi ``` so it will produce 3 files, namely:

- `qrscan-arm64-v8a-release.apk`
- `qrscan-armeabi-v7a-release.apk`
- `qrscan-x86_64-release.apk`

So, before you install the app on your device, please check your CPU architecture first.
for arm64-v8a (ARM 64-bit), armeabi-v7a (ARM 32-bit),  and x86-64 (x86 64-bit).

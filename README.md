# QR Code Scanner App

This application is the result of a project created as a part of my job application process at PT Mypro Solusindo Informatika. The app is designed to scan valid QR codes and perform certain actions based on the type of QR code scanned.

To avoid fat apk, I build apk with the command ``` flutter build apk --split-per-abi ``` so it will produce 3 files, namely:

- `qrscan-arm64-v8a-release.apk`
- `qrscan-armeabi-v7a-release.apk`
- `qrscan-x86_64-release.apk`

So, before you install the app on your device, please check your CPU architecture first.
for arm64-v8a (ARM 64-bit), armeabi-v7a (ARM 32-bit),  and x86-64 (x86 64-bit).
